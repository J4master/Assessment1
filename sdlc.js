// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfReq = "This is the second step which demands correct requirements gathering, the efficient examination of requirements gathered, and clear requirement documentation as a precondition"
const design = "This is the third step, where software developers define the technical details of the product"
const implement = "This is the fourth step, which includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes."
const test = "This is the fifth step, in which a software implementation is packaged and tested to assure quality."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, which is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs "
